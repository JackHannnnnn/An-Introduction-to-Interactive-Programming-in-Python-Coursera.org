# An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python
This course by Rice University contains interactive mini projects completed in CodeSkulptor which is an interactive, web-based Python programming environment that allows Python code to be run in a web browser.

I put the code of three mini interactive games in this repository. It won't work if you run the code directly in Python since the CodeSkulptor this course uses contains its own mini GUI, namely `simplegui` instead of standard GUI in Python like Tkinter. Therefore, I put the three links to my code in CodeSkulptor which will direct you to a page where you can click on a 'run-like' graphic button to play the games. 

The first game is **RiceRocks(Asteroids)** whose link is [http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_npmbmMc3yD9L4sq_9.py](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_npmbmMc3yD9L4sq_9.py). 
- In this game, you use four arrows on the keyboard to control the direction and speed of the spaceship and press the space key to fire bullets to destroy meteorites. We recommend using the Chrome browser for this game to run smoothly and perfectly.

The second game is **Blackjack** whose link is [http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_P19We1NJW9gCtO0.py](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_P19We1NJW9gCtO0.py).

The last game is **Memory** whose link is [http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_6xs32MwRxq2RbEw.py](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user40_6xs32MwRxq2RbEw.py).
- Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. If they match, the player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number of turns. For this project, we will keep our model for Memory fairly simple. A Memory deck consists of eight pairs of matching cards.
